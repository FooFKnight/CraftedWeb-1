    Congratulations, you've now installed the CraftedWeb CMS on your web host. We sincerely hope that you will enjoy all of our hard work on this CMS. Leave a comment on the forum post, and tell us what you think of it. And also report any errors and stuff. Thanks!
    <br />
    <b>* TIP!</b> Make a backup of your configuration file. If you accidently remove or wipe the data from it, your entire site will stop working.
</p>
<p>
    <code>Now, remove the /install folder completely. Otherwise the website will redirect the user to the installation page. (You can also just rename the folder, but due to security reasons, we suggest that you remove it completely.</code>
    <code><b>How do I customize my website even further?</b> There's alot more options to explore in the configuration file, and on the Admin panel. Open the <i>includes/configuration.php</i> file to customize Alot more. Everything should be explained there, so don't worry, you will understand what all settings are for. 
        (* Tip: Do not use regular Windows notepad, since the file will look very wierd with notepad. ).</code>
